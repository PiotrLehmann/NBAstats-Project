# NBAstats-Project
GUI for NBA fans who want to check statistics of players and teams. 
Project uses selenium to web scrape needed informations from official NBA website,
and presents them in quite clean looking GUI written in Java. You can sort tables by every stat, scroll through latest game scores and check
if Lebron James already passed Kareem on All Time Scoring List. Moving between sections is allowed by menu bar.
